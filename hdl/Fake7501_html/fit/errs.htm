It is recommended that you declare this BUFG   explicitedly in your design. Note that for certain device families the output   of a BUFG constraint can not drive a gated clock, and the BUFG constraint   will be ignored.INFO:Cpld - Inferring BUFG constraint for signal 'clock' based upon the LOC   constraint 'P27'.
